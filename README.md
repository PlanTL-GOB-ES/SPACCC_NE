## Document selection

The SPACCC corpus was created after collecting 1,000 clinical cases from SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online), 
an electronic library that gathers electronic publications of complete full text articles from scientific journals of 
Latin America, South Africa and Spain (http://www.scielo.org).

A clinician classified those cases into those that were similar to real clinical texts in terms of structure and content
and those that were not suitable for this task. Figure legends were automatically removed and in case multiple clinical 
cases were listed, these were split into single clinical cases.


## Annotation format


## Annotation guidelines

The annotation guidelines describe the criteria that have been followed to annotate the corpus, along with illustrative 
examples. 

Guidelines have been written and developed in Spanish and are only available in Spanish.
